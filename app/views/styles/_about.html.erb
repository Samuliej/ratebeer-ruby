    The classification of beer into distinct styles is a relatively modern concept, though beer itself is one of the oldest beverages in human history, dating back over 7,000 years. Ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Babylonians brewed beer, but these early brews varied greatly depending on local ingredients, brewing methods, and regional tastes. There was no formal categorization of "styles" at the time—beer was simply beer.

    It wasn’t until the 18th and 19th centuries, particularly in Europe, that recognizable beer styles began to emerge. In places like Germany, Belgium, and England, local traditions and ingredients started to shape consistent brewing practices. For example, the Bavarian Weissbier, the English Porter, and the Czech Pilsner all arose from specific regions and became associated with particular brewing techniques, ingredients, and flavor profiles.

    The concept of defining and categorizing beer styles gained more traction in the 20th century. In the 1970s and 1980s, beer writers like Michael Jackson (author of The World Guide to Beer) played a key role in popularizing the idea of beer styles. His work helped preserve traditional styles and inspired the craft beer revolution, particularly in the United States.

    Today, beer styles are more important than ever, with organizations like the Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) and the Brewers Association maintaining comprehensive style guidelines. These styles not only help consumers understand what to expect in a beer but also support brewers in preserving and innovating on centuries-old brewing traditions.
